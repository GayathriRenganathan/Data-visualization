# Reflection:

Though I had experience working with data and plots earlier. This class helped me understand my weakness and addressed the areas of improvement through various learning criteria. In this portfolio I have created 4 plots and 1 table to show how I have mastered the criteria listed in the syllabus. Throughout the semester your feedback has indicated I needed to work particularly hard on a few criteria that I was initially weak on.
I missed to capture on a few criteria in the assignments

* 1. - How to keep the charts simple, how to effectively communicate with simple chart, 
* 11. -using incorrect histogram bin width and how to avoid illusion effects in the chart.

I have worked on the feedback and addressed on my plot 1,2 and table 1 to keep the plots/table simple enough to address the questions (criteria: 1). Plot 1: also addresses the issue of using correct bin width to explain the data effectively(Criteria 11.d).
In some of my assignments the color selections in the plot has led to illusion effects. I have worked hard to avoid the illusion effects in the final portfolio in all the plots.

In most assignments I had trouble to make the plot/table simple and effective. With practice,
I have now successfully eliminated these problems (criteria 1) in all of the plots that follow. As a result, I think I deserve an **A** in the course, as my portfolio shows I have mastered almost all the criteria and have improved dramatically on those that I was struggling with before.

My portfolio plots are designed to specifically show mastery in the following criteria:

*  Whole Portfolio - 2,3,10,11,12,13,14
*  1, a plot - 1, 4, 5
*  2, a basic bar plot, 1, 7
*  3, a faceted plot -  1, 6, 7
*  4, a table -  1, 3, 7
*  5, sankey diagram - 4, 5, 7

# Question 
What is the distribution of ages of the driver that caused the accident?

crashReport <- read.csv("Tempe_Crash_Data_Report_2024.csv")

# To get the drivers who caused the accident , we can check if the driver has  
# done any violation / alcohol use / drug use
# 
# For Driver1, Remove the records age > 100 and filter for 'Driver' type 
# Filter drivers without any violations

#Combine Driver1 and Driver2 dataset
crashReport_cleaned = rbind(crashReport_Drv1_cleaned, 
                            crashReport_Drv2_cleaned)

# Calculate the average age of the Drivers
mean_age <- round(mean(crashReport_cleaned$Age_Drv), 2)

# Annotation data for Geom_text in Histogram
annotations <- data.frame(x = 45, y = 12000, 
                          label = paste("Mean:", mean_age ))

  scale_x_continuous(
    breaks = c(seq(10, 110, 10))
  )+
  labs(x = "Age", y = "Number of Accidents")
```
**Plot 1:** The Histogram plot shows the age distribution of the drivers that caused the accident. Accidents are more prominent in the young age drivers in the age of 18 to 28. The number of accidents decreases as the age of the driver increases. Very few accidents in the range of 13 -18 years indicates that people are driving without proper license or possible data entry issue.


\newpage
# Question 
What is the distribution of ages of the driver across gender that caused the accident?

# Plot

```{r plot2}

# Color coding for different gender
cols <- c("brown1", "deepskyblue")

# Density plot to show the density distribution of the Driver's age
ggplot(data= crashReport_cleaned, aes(x = Age_Drv, fill = Gender))+ 
  geom_density(alpha = 0.5)+ 
  scale_fill_manual(values = cols)+
  labs(x = "Age of the Drivers", y = "Density")
```
**Plot2:** The Density plot shows the age distribution of the Drivers that caused the accident across Gender. Age distribution is similar for Female and Male with minor differences. Female drivers has slightly higher accidents than male drivers until the age of 25. Male drivers has slightly higher accidents than female drivers in the age group of 30-60 years.

**Plot 3:** The line plot shows the trend of how the Average Doctor charges and Average Facility charges varied over the years. Average Facility charges are very high compared to the Average Doctor charges across all the years. The average facility charges are elevated when surgery was performed. The average doctor charges are slightly higher when surgery was performed.

**Table 1:**  Summary statistics of emergency room(ER) visit total charges from 2017 to 2022 based on the MEPS Survey data in America. The increasing median total charges over the years highlights the rising uncertainity in ER costs. 


*Table Notes:*

*  All numbers are rounded off to the nearest hundreds.
*  Median, Q1, Q3 are in USD($).
*  Q1 refers to the first quartile (25th percentile), while Q3 refers to the third quartile (75th percentile) of the data.
